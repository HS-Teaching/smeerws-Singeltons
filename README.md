# smeerws-Singeltons

This unity project serves as reference for the implementation of the Singelton design pattern. 
The Singelton design pattern can be used for saving data between scenes. 

The implementation of a Singleton design pattern within a class ensures that *only one* instance of the object 
ever exists at any one time. 
Use Singeltons for controller classes such as GameManager, GameController, etc.
